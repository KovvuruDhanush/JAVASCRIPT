// ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) brought a significant revolution to JavaScript by introducing several new features and improvements.
// Here's a detailed explanation of why ES6 is so famous and the key features it introduced:

// 1. Let and Const Keywords:
//    - 'let' and 'const' replaced the traditional 'var' for declaring variables.
//    - 'let' provides block-scoping, helping avoid common issues with variable hoisting and scoping.

// 2. Arrow Functions:
//    - Arrow functions offer a more concise syntax for creating functions.
//    - They automatically bind the value of 'this' based on the surrounding context.
//    - They're particularly useful for callbacks and inline functions.

// 3. Default Parameters:
//    - Functions can have default parameter values, simplifying function calls where some parameters are optional.

// 4. Template Literals and Multi-line Strings:
//    - Template literals allow embedding expressions within strings using '${}' syntax.
//    - They support multi-line strings without the need for concatenation or escaping.

// 5. Destructuring:
//    - Destructuring simplifies extracting values from arrays and objects by providing a more concise syntax.

// 6. Higher Order Functions:
//    - ES6 introduced built-in higher-order functions like 'map', 'filter', and 'reduce' for more functional programming styles.

// 7. Promises:
//    - Promises provide a structured way to handle asynchronous operations, making async code more readable and maintainable.

// 8. Classes:
//    - ES6 introduced a class syntax that simplifies creating and working with constructor functions and prototypes.
//    - It's more similar to class-based languages like Java or C++.

// 9. Modules:
//    - ES6 introduced a standardized module system using 'import' and 'export' statements.
//    - This allows better code organization, reuse, and maintenance.

// ES6's features make code more readable, maintainable, and less error-prone.
// It aligned JavaScript more closely with modern programming languages and improved developer productivity.
// The introduction of these features made ES6 a landmark in JavaScript's evolution, which is why it's widely adopted and famous in the developer community.
// Subsequent versions of ECMAScript (ES7, ES8, etc.) continued to build upon these improvements and introduced additional features to enhance the language further.
