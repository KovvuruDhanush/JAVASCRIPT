'use strict'; // The 'use strict' directive is used to enable strict mode in JavaScript.

let a = 10; // Declaring a variable 'a' and assigning the value 10 to it.
console.log(a); // Outputting the value of 'a' to the console.





// Explanation:

// 'use strict';: This directive is used to enable strict mode in JavaScript. In strict mode, certain coding practices are restricted or changed to prevent common coding mistakes and "bad" syntax from being silently ignored. For example, in strict mode, assigning values to undeclared variables or using reserved words as variable names will result in errors. It promotes more disciplined and safer coding.

// let a = 10;: This line declares a variable named a using the let keyword and assigns the value 10 to it. In strict mode, you need to declare variables before using them, which helps avoid accidental global variable leaks.

// console.log(a);: This line prints the value of the variable a to the console. In this case, it will output 10.

// By using 'use strict' and following best practices, your code becomes more reliable, easier to debug, and less prone to certain types of errors.
