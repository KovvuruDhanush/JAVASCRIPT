function hello() {

// Using setInterval to execute the hello function every 1000 milliseconds (1 second).
let timer = setInterval(hello, 1000);

// Explanation:

// You've defined a function named hello that logs "hello" to the console.

// The setInterval function is used to repeatedly execute the hello function every 1000 milliseconds (1 second). It returns a numeric ID (timer in this case) that can be used later to stop the interval.

// The setTimeout function is used to set a timeout of 3000 milliseconds (3 seconds). After this delay, the callback function provided to setTimeout is executed.

// Inside the setTimeout callback function, clearInterval(timer) is called to stop the interval execution. This function clears the interval specified by the timer ID.

// In this code, the hello function is executed every second (thanks to the setInterval), but after 3 seconds, the clearInterval function is called, which stops the repeated execution of the hello function. This demonstrates how you can control the timing of repeated function executions using these timer functions.
