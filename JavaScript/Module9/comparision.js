// Explanation:

// You've defined a variable a with the value 2.
// You've defined a variable b with the value '2', which is a string containing the character '2'.
// You've used the loose equality operator (==) to compare the values of a and b. This operator performs type coercion, which means it converts operands to the same type before making the comparison. In this case, the string '2' is converted to a number 2 for the comparison. Since the values are equal, the result is true.
// You've used the strict equality operator (===) to compare the values and types of a and b. This operator doesn't perform type coercion. Since a is a number and b is a string, their types are different, and the result is false.
// The comments in the code explain the behavior of loose and strict equality comparisons.
// Remember:

// == checks for equality after performing type coercion.
// === checks for equality without performing type coercion. It requires both values and types to be the same for the comparison to be true.
// In your example, a and b have the same value but different types, so a == b is true due to type coercion, while a === b is false because strict equality requires both values and types to match.
