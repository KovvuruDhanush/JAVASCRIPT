// In the code you provided, you're initializing two variables firstperson and secondperson with the value "kovvuru dhanush". Then, you're changing the value of firstperson to "Maari" and printing both firstperson and secondperson to the console.

// Here's what happens step by step:

// You initialize the variable firstperson with the value "kovvuru dhanush".
// You initialize the variable secondperson with the same value as firstperson, which is "kovvuru dhanush".
// You change the value of the firstperson variable to "Maari".
// You print the value of firstperson, which is now "Maari".
// You print the value of secondperson, which is still "kovvuru dhanush" because it was assigned the value of firstperson earlier and was not updated when you changed the value of firstperson.
// So, the output of your code will be:

// Copy code
// Maari
// kovvuru dhanush
